Until recently, your symptoms (especially trembling in hands and legs, loss of balance) were effectively controlled by medication. Recently they have got a lot worse. You have organised an OT review of your home, which you share with your spouse and two teenage children, to minimise falling hazards and make it easier to perform everyday tasks. You feel anxious about the future, and seek reassurance.<\/p>\r\n  <\/dd>\r\n\r\n  <dt class=\"col-sm-3\">TASK<\/dt>\r\n  <dd class=\"col-sm-9\"><ul><li>When asked, explain that you want to know what changes can be made to make life easier and safer when your symptoms get worse.<\/li><li> Explain that when you are tired you can't be bothered cleaning up completely after meals. <\/li><li>You would like to know how to operate more safely in the kitchen.<\/li><li> Ask if the living room and hallways can be made safer.<\/li><li> They are not very tidy because your family is messy. <\/li><li>Find out how you can feel safer when you are home alone.<\/li><\/ul><\/dd>\r\n\r\n<\/dl><hr><b><h3>CANDIDATE CARD NO. 1<\/h3><\/b><hr><dl class=\"row\">\r\n  <dt class=\"col-sm-3\">SETTING<\/dt>\r\n  <dd class=\"col-sm-9\">Home Visit<\/dd>\r\n\r\n  <dt class=\"col-sm-3\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">THERAPIST<\/span><\/dt>\r\n  <dd class=\"col-sm-9\">\r\n    <p>A home re-assessment has been requested by a 51-year-old Parkinson's disease sufferer. He\/she lives with his\/her spouse and two teenage children and was diagnosed 15 years ago, but the disease progressed slowly and symptoms have been well controlled until now. A sudden escalation of symptoms (especially tremor and loss of balance) has prompted the patient to request your visit.

Recommend they simplify tasks to conserve energy.<\/li><li> Suggest further home modifications &ndash; in shower (chair, tap, no step) in passages (rails, lighting, power cords) in bedroom (phone by bed; radio phone when alone).<\/li><li> Promote the idea of increased community support: family meetings, community involvement, and support groups.<\/li><p><\/p><\/ul><\/dd>\r\n\r\n<\/dl>\n",
