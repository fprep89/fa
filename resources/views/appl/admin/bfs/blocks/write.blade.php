		<h3>How is Writing Evaluated?</h3>
		<p>At First Academy, we take evaluations very seriously. We understand the difference between getting a 6.5 and a 7.0.  All our trainers thoroughly understand the all the evaluation parameters of IELTS. Here is a sample of one of our evaluations.  In this evaluation:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The first page includes the writing tasks with mistakes underlined.</li>
<li>The second page includes all of the above in addition to brief explanations of what these mistakes are.</li>
<li>The final page includes trainer comments along with a tentative band score.</li>
